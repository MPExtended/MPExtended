            /* In the beginning, this code was written and it was simple, and everything was good. Then, someone deleted their local files, and the code
             * broke. It was fixed by ignoring all episodes that don't have local files (INNER JOIN local_episodes), and requiring all shows to have 
             * local files (s.HasLocalFiles = 1), and everything was good again (commit 76191b6).
             * 
             * Then, people started having more exotic databases, and this proved broken too. There were two apparant problems:
             * - The HasLocalFiles flag doesn't work the way we expected it to work. There were episodes for shows with HasLocalFiles = 0 is returned from
             *   the GetAllEpisodes() method below, even though that one still has the INNER JOIN on local_episodes. This caused problems with clients who
             *   rightfully expected the show for an episode to exist. 
             * - Some users wanted to have shows without any local files showing up in their WebMediaPortal. Don't ask wny.
             * So, the requirement for s.HasLocalFiles = 1 was dropped (commit 926841b), and everything was good again.
             * 
             * But it wasn't good enough. People deleted shows from their databases, and people started complaining again: their deleted shows were being
             * shown in WebMediaPortal. The obvious solution would be to require s.HasLocalFiles = 1 again, but the world isn't simple anymore.
             * 
             * So, what we're doing is:
             * - We completely ignore all flags we encounter in the online_series table. They may be right, they may be wrong, they may be misnamed or they
             *   may be obsolete, I've no idea. We'll ignore them so that we don't turn insane. 
             * - For loading the number of (unwatched) episodes, we always use a subquery that queries the online_episodes table with an INNER JOIN on the
             *   local_episodes table. This was actually added somewhere in the middle of the story above, because MP-TVSeries counted episodes without an
             *   entry in local_episodes as an unwatched episode too. That isn't directly problematic, but since we ignore those episodes, the episode count
             *   was bigger than the number of episodes returned from GetAllEpisodes(). That confused some clients, and it didn't make any sense at all.
             * - We don't return any shows or seasons that don't have any episodes using that method. That implies that we don't support seasons or shows 
             *   without any local episodes.
             * - We hope and pray that SQLite is smart enough to optimize the subquery and doesn't execute it for each show. 
             * 
             * And everything is good again. For now.
