// This reflects the version of this unique build, and should be changed with each build. Sadly it's not easily possible
// to let this change with each build in Visual Studio, so we don't have that in our version numbers now and hope people
// don't mess around too much with our builds. For stable releases, this is of the format major.minor.bugfix.0. For new 
// minor versions we use major.prev-minor.99.x, with x incrementing with each alpha/beta/RC release. For test versions of
// bugfix releases this is major.minor.prev-bugfix.x, with x incrementing with each alpha/beta/RC release. This number
// is also used to check for new versions in the configurator, so please follow this scheme strictly.
